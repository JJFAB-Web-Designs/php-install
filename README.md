# Automating PHP Install

Here we have made a Bash script used to automate PHP Web Server installs because we know they take too long to create and are a pain to even find out how to. This install is created by a pulling another Github Repository which contains a Docker-compose file for and the script will download that repository enter it and use the file to create an nginx, php and a database if required all inside 3 docker containers.
